# Spring JPA Concepts

## @Version Annotation

### Explanation

The `@Version` annotation is used in Spring Boot to prevent concurrent modifications to entities. When an entity is being updated, the version number is also incremented. If another transaction tries to update the same entity with the older version number, an exception will be thrown. This helps to prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions.

The `@Version` annotation can be used with any entity that has a version field. The version field can be of any numeric type, but it is typically an integer. Spring Boot automatically increments the version field every time an entity is updated.

The `@Version` annotation is a powerful tool that can help prevent data loss and corruption. It plays an essential role in Spring Boot's concurrency control mechanism.
