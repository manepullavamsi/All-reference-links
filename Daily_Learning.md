## @Version Annotation

### Explanation

The `@Version` annotation is used in Spring Boot to prevent concurrent modifications to entities. When an entity is being updated, the version number is also incremented. If another transaction tries to update the same entity with the older version number, an exception will be thrown. This helps to prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions.

The `@Version` annotation can be used with any entity that has a version field. The version field can be of any numeric type, but it is typically an integer. Spring Boot automatically increments the version field every time an entity is updated.

The `@Version` annotation is a powerful tool that can help prevent data loss and corruption. It plays an essential role in Spring Boot's concurrency control mechanism.

Here is an example of how to use the `@Version` annotation in Spring Boot:

```java
@Entity
public class Product {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    private String name;

    @Version
    private long version;

    // Getters and setters omitted
}

Here is an example of how to use the `@Version` annotation in Spring Boot:

```java
@Entity
public class Product {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    private String name;

    @Version
    private long version;

    // Getters and setters omitted
}
```

In this example, the `Product` entity has a version field called `version`. The version field is incremented automatically by Spring Boot every time the `Product` entity is updated.

In the following example, the `@Version` annotation is used to prevent concurrent modifications to entities:

```java
Product product = productRepository.findOne(1L);
product.setName("New name");
productRepository.save(product);
```

In this example, the `Product` entity is first fetched from the database. The name of the product is then changed, and the product is saved back to the database.

If another transaction is trying to update the same product at the same time, an exception will be thrown because the version number of the product has been incremented. This will prevent the data from being corrupted.
