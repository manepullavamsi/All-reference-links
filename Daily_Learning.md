### Explanation

The `@Version` annotation is used in Spring Boot to prevent concurrent modifications to entities. When an entity is being updated, the version number is also incremented. If another transaction tries to update the same entity with the older version number, an exception will be thrown. This helps to prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions.

The `@Version` annotation can be used with any entity that has a version field. The version field can be of any numeric type, but it is typically an integer. Spring Boot automatically increments the version field every time an entity is updated.

The `@Version` annotation is a powerful tool that can help prevent data loss and corruption. It plays an essential role in Spring Boot's concurrency control mechanism.


```markdown
@Entity
public class Product {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private long id;

    private String name;

    @Version
    private long version;

    // Getters and setters omitted
}
```

In this example, the `Product` entity has a version field called `version`. The version field is incremented automatically by Spring Boot every time the `Product` entity is updated.

---

In the following example, the `@Version` annotation is used to prevent concurrent modifications to entities:

```java
Product product = productRepository.findOne(1L);
product.setName("New name");
productRepository.save(product);
```

In this example, the `Product` entity is first fetched from the database. The name of the product is then changed, and the product is saved back to the database.

If another transaction is trying to update the same product at the same time, an exception will be thrown because the version number of the product has been incremented. This will prevent the data from being corrupted.

The `@Version` annotation is a powerful tool that can help to prevent data loss and corruption. It is an important part of Spring Boot's concurrency control mechanism.

Sql Things

    <summary> OFFSET </summary>
    In SQL, the term "offset" is commonly used in combination with the "LIMIT" clause to control the number of rows returned by a query and to specify how many rows should be skipped before starting to retrieve rows. This is often used for implementing pagination or retrieving subsets of data.

Here's the basic syntax for using "LIMIT" and "OFFSET" in an SQL query:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows_to_return OFFSET number_of_rows_to_skip;
```

- `LIMIT`: Specifies the maximum number of rows to be returned by the query.
- `OFFSET`: Specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to retrieve rows.

For example, suppose you have a table called "employees" and you want to retrieve 10 records starting from the 11th record (i.e., skipping the first 10 records). You can use OFFSET and LIMIT like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```

This query would return records 11 to 20 from the "employees" table.

Keep in mind that the behavior of OFFSET and LIMIT can vary depending on the database management system (DBMS) you are using. Some DBMSs might use different syntax or provide alternative ways to achieve similar results.
